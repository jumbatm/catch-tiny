# Catch Tiny - A light, header-only testing framework
based on Catch2.

If you only need `TEST_CASE`, `SECTION` and `REQUIRE` macros, simply replace `catch.hpp`.

# Usage
Testing revolves around the macros described above. 
A test is declared with 
```cpp
TEST_CASE(const char *name)
{
    // ...
}
```
, where you can name your test. This name is thrown back at you if any assertions you make fail, so you know where to look. Inside these test cases, you can use

```cpp
REQUIRE(bool b);
```
to make assertions of your code. If these fail, you'll see output like:
```
In test case: "Internal pointer is set to null after class is destructed."
	Assertion failed: REQUIRE(ptr == nullptr) at sections.cpp:27
```
Just like with Catch2, make sure you define `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` before including `catch.hpp` in one file, like:
```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN // Define this in ONE FILE ONLY.
#include "catch.hpp"
```
Catch Tiny will provide a main function which runs all the tests compiled with it.

In its most basic form, a test might look something like this:

#### main.cpp

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"
```

#### and_test.cpp

```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"

template <bool B1, bool B2>
struct And
{
    static constexpr bool value = false;
};

template <>
struct And<true, true>
{
    static constexpr bool value = true;
};

TEST_CASE("And struct behaves like logical AND")
{
    REQUIRE(And<true, true>::value);
    REQUIRE(And<false, true>::value == false);
    REQUIRE(And<true, false>::value == false);
}

```
